# Figma-to-HTML-CSS_10Projects
A personal challenge to transform 10 Figma designs into fully responsive HTML and CSS webpages. Each project focuses on mastering front-end development techniques, honing design-to-code skills, and practicing responsive and modern web design principles. This repo is part of my ongoing journey to strengthen my front-end development skills.

Here are the websites I've built:

1. Automotive Car
2. Fashion Clothes
3. Shoes Footwear
4. Legal Law Firm
5. News Magazine
